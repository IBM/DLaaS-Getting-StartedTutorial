If you do not have MITIBMAiLab under Cloud Foundry Org, stop here and contact Noor Fairoza via slack or email.

### 2. Python
If either python or pip are not installed, Goto [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
and follow instructions to install them.

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted; iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ibm.biz/idt-win-installer')
```
 
#### 3.2 Install Machine learning plugin
```
$ bx plugin install machine-learning -r Bluemix
```

#### 3.3 Install  Watson ML Client   library and plugin  for the IBM  Cloud CLI

#### Python Compatibility issues
If you have any concerns about python version compatibility, we suggest you use Anaconda.

[instructions](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)


##### To select a specific version of python
First, make sure you have the latest version of conda by running
```
$ conda update conda
```
Then run, e.g.,
```
$ conda install python=3.6
```
or any version you need

You can visit this link for reference [https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-python.html)
 
#### `Note for Windows users: - `
 please make sure that the python executable path is set in the environment variable `‘path’`.
 
Visit to `system properties`. 
Click on `environment variable`s.
Click on `‘path’` variable and click on `edit`.
Verify if the path of your python executable is preset in the list. If not, clock on ‘`New`’ button and 

add the path. Click `OK`.
